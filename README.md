# COP2510_Programming_Concepts

This is a collection of the author's lab assignments from his "COP 2510 (Programming Concepts)" class at the University of South Florida (USF), taken in Spring 2022 semester. This folder showcases only 7 of the author's assignments, and each of which are described briefly below. For most assignments, a more detailed description of what the program performs is written in the respective folder corresponding to the lab assignment (titled, for example, "lab1.pdf").

  1. Lab 1:
    (i) Python script to estimate the area of a circle, given circumference 100 units.
    (ii) Python script to estimate the area of a flower, given radius 4.5 units.
    (iii) Python script to estimate the area of a flower, given a user-inputted radius.
    (iv) Python script to estimate the dollar value of a loan, given user-inputted Principle, Rate, and Time.
  
  2. Lab 2: Python script for the game "One Bid", for four contestants' bids versus a true price (all user-inputted).
  
  3. Lab 3: Python script to translaste the "One Bid" script from Lab 3 into incorporating an arbitrary number of contestants (as opposed to the fixed number of four contestants).
  
  4. Lab 4: Python script to simulate a game of Snakes and Ladders, given a pre-generated game board.
  
  5. Lab 5: Python script to simulate a game of Snakes and Ladders by independently generating a board with a custom count of snakes and ladders in the game board.
  
  6. Lab 6: Python script reading a file describing a game of Uno and describing the current state of the game. Game files are provided in the folder; file name must be inputted by the user during runtime, and are titled "lab6_game1.txt", lab6_game2.txt", and "lab6_game3.txt".
  
  7. Lab 8: Python script simulating an exam containing Fill In The Blanks questions and Multiple Choice questions, using Python Classes. Sample exam files are provided in the folder; file name must be inputted by the user during runtime. Note that the "question.py", "exam.py", "pyexam.txt" described in the document "lab8.pdf" have been renamed to "lab8_saaket_raman.py", "lab8_exam_script.py", and "lab8_pyexam.txt" respectively.
